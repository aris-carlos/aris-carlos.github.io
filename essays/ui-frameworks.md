_"In general, bootstrapping usually refers to a self-starting process that is supposed to continue or grow without external input. - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping#:~:text=In%20general%2C%20bootstrapping%20usually%20refers%20to%20a%20self%2Dstarting%20process%20that%20is%20supposed%20to%20continue%20or%20grow%20without%20external%20input.)"_

## Frameworks To Do More

Before I dove deeper into Software Engineering, my knowledge of frameworks was limited just to knowing that they exist; I had no idea what they were and what their application was. 

Occasionally in the past when I've looked at sample resumes of my fellow peers to get ideas for what I should put on mine, many times I would see terms listed under the skills section such as "React", "SemanticUI", and "Bootstrap"--all of which that I first thought were additional programming languages that I had never heard of before. After being introduced to frameworks , I think past me was actually right, frameworks in a sense are like their own programming language.
