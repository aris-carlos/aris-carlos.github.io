## The Learning Process

In the process of getting better at something, one needs to learn the material that pertains to their subject. Whether they are learning the jargon, the rules, the processes, or any knowledge needed to perform a job, carry out a hobby, or anything they want to do, the process of getting better and more knowledgeable comes down to learning. Regardless of whether the new knowledge comes directly or indirectly, everyday is a learning opportunity. However, sometimes people will stumble across a struggle in their learning. The great thing is that there are other resources out there to sustain the struggle. One of these great resources are other people; people who have been through the learning process that others are currently going through. To learn from others, you’d need to ask questions: a way of communicating a problem to hopefully receive a solution in return. However, even people as resources can be depleted too, and many of those times, it comes down to the questions they receive. So what might be the best way to maximize your learning from questions? Asking <b>smart</b> questions.

## A Good Answer Or Just An Answer

Any question can be asked, but at the same time, any answer can be provided (even an answer of just nothingness). This isn’t just some form of randomness or luck that will determine what type of answer you will get, but rather it will all come down to the type of question you ask. Many experts in the various communities that exist, particularly the tech community, get flooded with questions from others trying to get answers to fill in knowledge gaps or overcome struggles in their learning. At the end of the day though, many of those who bear the answers are getting frustrated. In general, it's good to ask questions, but the type of question that is asked will make the difference between learning something versus indirectly frustrating someone. It all comes down to the level of effort demonstrated in trying to solve the problem at hand before asking others. Many get annoyed by those who want the simple way out despite all the various resources out there that can give them an answer. However, if effort was demonstrated that you tried to figure things out on your own before seeking help, then you may get the more rewarding answer that will put everything together.

As one who is embarking on the journey of pursuing computer science, it's important to ask smart questions because it all ties back to the learning process we all undergo. One big takeaway in asking smart questions comes down to the effort that is put in beforehand. Being in the computer science field, much of my learning is meant to come from my own actions, not by being spoon fed to me. This means that to improve my programming skills, I need to code more. If I want to learn how software and projects work in the industry, then I should build something. As someone who is fortunate enough to have many resources available for my learning, I shouldn't have excuses to put in the effort to overcome any struggles in my learning. Although, not all instances of finding my solution on my own will work out successfully. However, the effort of me trying to figure out the problem on my own beforehand is still present, as it will at least help put me on the same page as the others who I am seeking help from. Through research and self-troubleshooting, this effort can help me to form a question where I can get down to the specifics of what my issue is, the resources I referred to, and the solutions I tried for me to receive a more pinpoint solution that will not only solve my problem, but also give me something to learn from and carry on with me.

## Seriously, Just Don’t

One example of not being smart when it comes to seeking help through questions is by straight up just asking an answer/solution without putting any effort in finding the answer on your own. There are some questions that can be answered easily by just referring to other available resources, such as documentation and manuals, forums, FAQ sections, etc. In the case of this example here, none of that was demonstrated. 

On [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2727922/in-c-printf-returns-what), the question asked is as follows:

    “in c printf() returns what?” 

The question received perhaps the most sarcastic yet judgmental responses. The responses did provide pointers into how that individual could have found their answer, but it was all surrounded with the implicit message of, “Really? Well, you could have done better. Here’s how.” The question was very effortless: the level of detail was at the absolute minimum, and no effort was demonstrated to showcase that a solution was being sought for before reaching out to the community of experts. This ends up taking up space on a forums page and wasting valuable time and resources from experts. Even Stack Overflow presents a message at the top saying:

```
It's difficult to tell what is being asked here.
This question is ambiguous, vague, incomplete, overly broad, or rhetorical and cannot be reasonably answered in its current form.
```

Though, this question post does serve as a valuable lesson to all answer-seekers out there, and that is to do your research to find your answers before asking a question, as a desired solution can sometimes be found right in front of you with all the resources available nowadays.

## Let's Get To the Specifics

So in the end, we realize that all engineering and programming is there for a reason - to serve human needs. Maybe that's why those things are difficult, because they both involve humans and are for humans.

Relationships, regardless if they're romantic or not take work. Humans are fickle creatures and relationships can come and go with the wind. To properly maintain something over time requires work. Family takes work. Marriage takes work. We live to figure out what works and what doesn't and hope that as we move forward we're improving.

Relationships have always been difficult, and by nature will continue to be so.

## Okay!

So back to the original premise; why is being one of the club officers so difficult?

And the final answer - it's supposed to be difficult, and it's supposed to challenge you, just like everything else that humans do that is difficult: programming, engineering, engaging in relationships, pondering the universe, etc.

Ultimately the question you should really ask yourself if something if particularly difficult is then "is it worth it"? That is something that is context specific and only you can answer yourself.aw
