## The Learning Process

In the process of getting better at something, one needs to learn the material that pertains to their subject. Whether they are learning the jargon, the rules, the processes, or any knowledge needed to perform a job, carry out a hobby, or anything they want to do, the process of getting better and more knowledgeable comes down to learning. Regardless of whether the new knowledge comes directly or indirectly, everyday is a learning opportunity. However, sometimes people will stumble across a struggle in their learning. The great thing is that there are other resources out there to sustain the struggle. One of these great resources are other people; people who have been through the learning process that others are currently going through. To learn from others, you’d need to ask questions: a way of communicating a problem to hopefully receive a solution in return. However, even people as resources can be depleted too, and many of those times, it comes down to the questions they receive. So what might be the best way to maximize your learning from questions? Asking <b>smart</b> questions.

## A Good Answer Or Just An Answer

Any question can be asked, but at the same time, any answer can be provided (even an answer of just nothingness). This isn’t just some form of randomness or luck that will determine what type of answer you will get, but rather it will all come down to the type of question you ask. Many experts in the various communities that exist, particularly the tech community, get flooded with questions from others trying to get answers to fill in knowledge gaps or overcome struggles in their learning. At the end of the day though, many of those who bear the answers are getting frustrated. In general, it's good to ask questions, but the type of question that is asked will make the difference between learning something versus indirectly frustrating someone. It all comes down to the level of effort demonstrated in trying to solve the problem at hand before asking others. Many get annoyed by those who want the simple way out despite all the various resources out there that can give them an answer. However, if effort was demonstrated that you tried to figure things out on your own before seeking help, then you may get the more rewarding answer that will put everything together.



## Seriously, Just Don’t

Ever hear people ragging on engineering companies for delivering late and way over budget? Well, some engineering jobs are really difficult, especially if the requirements and funding are undulating underneath you. Because of the nature of the problem, sometimes engineering firms require large amounts of engineers and workers, inviting further problems and delays.

The Honolulu Rail project at home has become this sort of poster child of failure, budget overrun and overall incompetence in Hawaii. Well, working though regulatory boards and fiscal procedures in Hawaii seems like it's a mind bogglingly difficult job to do. Granted, there might be some fishy stuff going on, but I refuse to believe that everyone is involved for nefarious reasons.

The problem of creating an unprecedented public transportation backbone on an island is difficult! I'm not sure we would have done it right, even if the best people were involved.

## In the context of relationships

So in the end, we realize that all engineering and programming is there for a reason - to serve human needs. Maybe that's why those things are difficult, because they both involve humans and are for humans.

Relationships, regardless if they're romantic or not take work. Humans are fickle creatures and relationships can come and go with the wind. To properly maintain something over time requires work. Family takes work. Marriage takes work. We live to figure out what works and what doesn't and hope that as we move forward we're improving.

Relationships have always been difficult, and by nature will continue to be so.

## Okay!

So back to the original premise; why is being one of the club officers so difficult?

And the final answer - it's supposed to be difficult, and it's supposed to challenge you, just like everything else that humans do that is difficult: programming, engineering, engaging in relationships, pondering the universe, etc.

Ultimately the question you should really ask yourself if something if particularly difficult is then "is it worth it"? That is something that is context specific and only you can answer yourself.aw
